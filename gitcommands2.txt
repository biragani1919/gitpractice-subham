Basically we do have three stages in lehman language, 
Untrack , staging and tracking
track stage is local one which is from git initiated folder (Not local data -when you initiate git init normal filesystem or
directory work as git untrack stage and you can see .git empty folder if you are using linux distribution)
staging is when you add the files to the git level whatever the files you have created it will be in stage mode, 
from here you can commit to git branch or bring it back to your untrack level.

# Below are the command which used as very basic practice.


git init
git status
git add
git add .
git status
git rm --cache <filename>
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git status
rm <filename>   - to remove the file from tracking stage
