what is the confusion to you
when you start git init deafault github already stored your 
hub url credentials, until unless you change , 
it will consider the same URL as your origin, whatever the code you are trying to update and 
push it will reach to same origin where it is registered.
trying to merge
I have created new branch challed test from master and trying to
initiate pull request and merge to practice


Have delted previous branches on local git and github level also
to check the pullrequest and merge works or not.

created dev to check pull and merge
After git merge successfully new updates pulled into master branch in local
now trying to push it to dev branch and after that will try to pr and merge
